        <p class="moody">Moody Park is one of the Upper Valley's most beginner friendly networks, with smooth trails, minimal elevation and a 
            fun beginner flow trail built by Sinuosity Trails. The trails are located in Moody Park in Claremont, NH which is run by 
            their parks department so be prepared to see lots of other users on the trails, such as hikers and runners. However,
            Stumpjumper (the flow trail) is one direction and bikes only so you don't need to worry about other trail users on 
            Stumpjumper. The trails in Moody Park are maintained by volunteers and The Wheel House bike shop. Moody Park only has 
            on trailhead at: <strong>152 Maple Ave, Claremont, NH 03743</strong>, which is also the park entrance. </p>
            <h2>What to bring?</h2>
            <p class="moody" id="moodystuff">Moody Park is fun on any mountain bike! There's no need for a super specialized bike, 
                just go and have fun. Moody Park has only 10 miles of trails so snacks probably are not needed, however, water is 
                recommended for any ride. For tools, it would be a good idea to bring a multitool but a tube and a flat kit are not a 
                necessity as you are never too far from your car.
            </p> 

            <h2>Recommended Trails</h2>
            <p>
                <em>Stumpjumper</em> is Moody Park's only machine-built trail, made by Sinuosity Flowing Trails. 
                It is an intermediate trail with fun jumps and berms. <em>Free Candy</em> is a great trial for anyone new to 
                mountain biking as it is very flat and smooth. It should be noted that it is possible to ride 90% of the 
                network as one large loop with some planning. 
            </p>
             <h2>Food and Lodging</h2>
             <p>
                The <em>Barn Cafe</em> has great coffee, breakfast, and lunch. <em>Ramunto's</em> New York pizza, a 
                sports bar and a great dining atmosphere. The <em>Common Man</em> is a good hotel on the Sugar River in Claremont. <em>Wilgus State
                Park</em> in Weathersfield, VT is the closest option for camping.  
             </p>
