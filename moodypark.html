        <h1>Moody Park</h1>
        <p>Moody Park is one of the Upper Valley's most beginner friendly networks, with smooth trails, minimal elevation and a 
            fun beginner flow trail built by Sinuosity Trails. The trails are located in Moody Park in Claremont, NH which is run by 
            their parks department so be prepared to see lots of other users on the trails, such as hikers and runners. However, the 
            Stumpjumper (the flow trail) is one direction and bikes only so you don't need to worry about other trail users on 
            Stumpjumper. The trails in Moody Park are maintained by volunteers and The Wheel House bike shop. Moody Park only has 
            on trailhead at: <strong>152 Maple Ave, Claremont, NH 03743</strong>, which is also the park entrance. </p>
            <h2>What to bring?</h2>
            <p>Moody Park is fun on any mountain bike! There's no need for super specialised bike, just go and have fun. 
                Moody Park has only 10 miles of trails so snacks probably are not needed, however water is recommended for any ride. 
                For tools it would be a good idea to bring a multitool but a tube and a flat kit is not a necessity as you 
                are never too far from your car.
