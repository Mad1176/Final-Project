        <h1>Arrowhead Recreation Area</h1>
        <p>
            Arrowhead's trails have recently been revamped by volunteers from the Wheelhouse bike shop. 
            They have created a network of fun and challenging downhill trails that host a round of the Maxxis ESC Enduro in the 
            early fall. These trails are enjoyed by enduro and downhill riders  throughout New England. The trails are Arrowhead are 
            known for being short, steep and filled with techncal features such as drops, jumps and rollers. The gravel climbing trail 
            is currently a multi-use trail and the recration area does have a few atv trails but all of the downhill bike trails are 
            one directoion and bike-only. The only trailhead is at <strong> 18 Robert Easter Way, Claremont, NH 03743</strong> and is also 
            the parking lot of the Arrowhead Recrational Area tubing and ski rope tow.  
        </p>
        <h2>What to bring?</h2>
        <p>Arrowhead probably contains some of the most technical and high-risk trails out of all the networks on this website.
             A cross-country bike is not recommended for this network, riders should have a long-travel bike such as an enduro or 
             downhill bike. Full-face helmets and knee pads are recommended for this trail network as well. However, since the
              runs are short here it is not nessicary to bring tools or a flat kit with you as you're always a short walk from the car.
               Water and snacks are optional to bring on the bike but it's never a bad idea to keep some in the car in case you get 
               hungry in between runs. 
             </p>
             <h2>Reccomended Trails</h2>
             <p>
                All of the trails on Arrowhead are accessed via the gravel climbing trail, this trail is steep but relatively short so 
                it is not uncommon to see people pushing their bikes up it. For people new to these trails it is recommended to start 
                on <em>Dirty Frank</em> or <em>Waka-Waka</em>, these trails are the only two not accessed from the summit and contain some of 
                the network's easier terrain. All of the other trails start at the summit of Arrowhead. <em>Conway</em> is one of the 
                network's longer trails and contains a very challenging rock roll. <em>Chubbs</em> is one of the shortest trails but 
                its steep lines and countless rollers will be enjoyed by any experienced rider. 
             </p>
             <h2>Food and Lodging</h2>
             <p>
                Since Arrowhead is also located in Claremont, it shares most of its food and lodging options with Moody Park. 
                The <em>Barn Cafe</em> is a great spot for breakfast or lunch and <em>Ramunto's</em> offers tasty pizza and is a good option for a 
                sit-down meal in Claremont. Sunapee, NH is also close to Claremont and offers some fancier options for dining and 
                lodging. For those looking for a hotel in Claremont, the <em>Common Man</em> is a good option and the closest campground would 
                be <em>Wilgus State Park</em>, just across the river in Vermont. 
             </p>
             <h2>Support Arrowhead</h2>
