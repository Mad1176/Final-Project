        <h1>Ascutney Trails</h1>
        <p id="at1">
            Ascutney Trails is one of the Upper Valley's largest trail networks with upwards of 30 miles of singletrack and is 
            constantly expanding. The trails in this network have a reputation of being tight, technical and climb-heavy, while this 
            is true for a decent portion of the trails here it is possible to find smoother trails here and a few select loops with 
            minimal elevation. They have also added a flow trail and a skills park built by Powder Horn Trail Company. 
            Ascutney Trails has three different trailheads with different types of riding, however all of the trails can be accessed from
            all of the trailheads.

                <dd>Ascutney Outdoors Center is the main trailhead with the largest parking lot, most infastruce and quickest 
                    access to the flow trail and skill park. This trailhead has the best access to their intermediate trails.</dd>
                <dt>881 Coaching Lane, Brownsville, VT 05037</dt>
                <dd>The Town Forest trail head is has a smaller parking with a small changing room. 
                    It offers the quickest access to Ascutney's most technical trails. </dd>
                <dt>1826 Back Mountain Road, Windsor, VT 05089</dt>
                <dd>This trailhead at the Ascutney state park offers access to Swoops and Loops as well 
                    as the Weathersfield Town forest. It is also possible to get to and from the main trails to the state park 
                    via the Norcross Trail.</dd>

            <h2>What to bring?</h2>
            <p>While you can ride these trails on any mountain bike, a cross country bike is recommended for 
                most trails as you will probably be doing a lot of climbing! If you are planning on just sessioning the 
                skills park a larger travel trail bike or dirt jumper would be better suited for the larger jumps. Given the amount 
                of trails in this network it is recommend that you bring food, water and tools in case of a mechanical. </p>
        
        <h2>Beginner Loop</h2>
        <p>The most beginner friendly trails will be found at the state park trailhead. The recommended loop is to start at the 
            trailhead and ride Swoops and Loops out of the side of the road where the state park entrance is, and then come back on 
            the opposing side of the road and when you return to the car you can cross the road again to ride Rick's Road to Cloudspin 
            and then return to the car back on Rick's Road. This loop would be roughly 6 miles on smooth trails with minimal elevation.<br>
