        <h1>Saskadena Six</h1>
        <p>
            Saskadena Six (formerly Suicide Six) is a ski resort in Woodstock owned by the Woodstock Inn. A few years ago they hired 
            Sinouisity Flowing Trails to build a small downhill park on the mountain and ran their chairlift in summer for their bike 
            park. Due to low ticket sales, the lift stopped running in summer after about two years, however, the trails remain and 
            are still being maintained. People now just pedal to the top to enjoy the trails. Saskaenda Six has a few traditional 
            bike park trails with jumps and big berms but it also has a few more natural trails with roots, rocks, and technical 
            features. The trails are short and fun which lets riders get in multiple laps. It should be noted that these trails close 
            as soon as winter operations start as it is still an active ski resort. The trailhead is located at 
            <strong>247 Stage Rd, South Pomfret, VT 05067</strong>.

        <h2>What to bring?</h2>
        <p>
            The trails at Saskadena Six can be ridden on any bike but a rider would probably get the most out of these trails on an 
            enduro or trail bike. Some of the trails Saskadena Six can be high risk if ridden at speed. If you are planning on riding 
            aggressively on the more technical trails here, knee pads or a full-face helmet might be recommended. The trail network is 
            relatively small so bringing tools with you is not a nessicary as you're never far from the car. 
        </p>
        <h2>Reccomended Trails</h2>
        <p>
            Most people use <em>First Drop</em> as the climbing trail, however, this trail is not one-way so climbers should be
             aware of people descending. <em>Avery's Interstate</em> is a fun intermediate trail with appropriately sized jumps and 
             large berms. The most popular advanced route is <em>Ask Your Father</em> to <em>Don't Tell Mom</em>, this trail is tighter than 
             Avery's Interstate and has more technical sections but it can still be ridden fast. 
        </p>
        <h2>Food and Lodging</h2>
        <p>
            Since Saskadena Six is located in Woodstock it shares the same food and lodging options as Aqueduct and Mont Peg. 
            The best options for lodging in the area would be the <em>Woodstock Inn</em> and <em>Quechee State Park</em>. A great 
            option for food is <em>Teago General Store</em>. They serve deli sandwiches and also have some baked goods. 
            Teago General Store is within riding distance from Saskadena Six.
