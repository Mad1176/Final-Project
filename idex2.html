        <h2>Trails in the Upper Valley</h2>
        <p id="UVT">
            The Upper Valley is a great place to go mountain biking as it has a very diverse and fun offering of trail networks. 
            There are so many trails that it is not uncommon for towns to have multiple unique trail networks. For this website, 
            the term “Upper Valley” refers to the area of Vermont and New Hampshire spanning the I-91 corridor from Windsor, Vermont 
            up to Lebanon, New Hampshire. The trails in the Upper Valley are generally known for being relatively technical and 
            having a lot of elevation gain and while this may be true for some trail systems, with the right information it is possible 
            to find smoother, more beginner-friendly terrain with less elevation. Most trail networks mentioned in this website have 
            decent infrastructure, which includes designated parking lots, trail maps, and usually bathrooms and changing facilities. 
            In addition to this, all of these trail networks are on Trailforks (a navigation application for MTB and hiking trails 
            available for both Android and Apple). This website will help visitors find the trail network that is the right fit for 
            them and prepare them for what to expect when they hit the trails. The trail networks that this webiste will cover are as follows:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Ascutney Trails</li>
